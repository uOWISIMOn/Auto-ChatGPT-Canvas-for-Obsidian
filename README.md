# Auto-ChatGPT-Canvas-for-Obsidian
Auto ChatGPT Canvas for Obsidian is a plugin that opens an in-app browser for ChatGPT and automatically detects parent–child links when you select text and click “Ask ChatGPT.” It then generates an Obsidian Canvas mind-map that visualizes the structure of your conversation.
